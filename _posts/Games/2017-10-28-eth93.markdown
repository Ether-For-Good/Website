description: Lottery Smart Contract with a cut of revenue going to charity.
---

### Description

The ETH93 smart contract offers a simple, entirely transparent lottery game running off the Ethereum blockchain. Each day, a lottery is held, and a random number is generated to determine the winner. 93% of ticket sales go to the winner and 5% go to an established charity. Our smart contract code has been verified on Etherscan and we welcome any criticism.

### Charity

[Heifer International's](https://www.heifer.org/) mission is to end hunger and poverty.
