### Description

Millionaire Makers is a [community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_this_not_a_lottery.3F) based off of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2mq94c/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and/) that proposed that if a million reddit users give $1 to a redditor, they can make him/her a millionaire. My idea is to create a similar lottery powered by Smart Contracts on Ethereum. However, as part of the "For Good" initiative charity organizations need to be worked into the picture.

### Charity

[Heifer International's](https://www.heifer.org/) mission is to end hunger and poverty.

### Status

This lottery is still very much in its infancy. There is [an archived reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6dhap3/a_smart_contract_that_combines_rmillionairemakers/) that brought up this idea, but nothing appears to have ever came of it. EtherForGood is very interested in creating the game, but would appreciate having some help.

##### Fund Allocation Proposal

1) 50% goes to Charity

2) 49% goes to the Winner

3) 1% Covers Operating Costs (gas, web services, developer)

##### Implementation Options

1) Make Millionaires: The smart contract waits until 2 million USD worth of Ethereum is raised before choosing a winner.

2) Raise A Million: The smart contract waits until 1 million USD worth of Ethereum is raised before choosing the winner

3) Forget Millions: It doesn't look like the actual Reddit group is even coming close to making millions either. In fact, the most it appears that anyone has ever won is only $11,400 with an average closer to $2,000.
