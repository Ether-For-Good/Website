### Mission:

The purpose of **Ether For Good** is to raise money for charity and nonprofit organizations. The incentive to donate is the potential to win big as well. All of the Games and Lotteries on the site donate approximately half of their total pot to a charity organization.

### Future Features:

With some help, **Ether For Good** could be turned into one of the largest sources of Charitable Donations on the web.

##### 1) User Accounts

Hopefully someday there will be user accounts for keeping track of spending, earning, favorite games, automatic re-enrolling, and more

##### 2) Charity Pages

An index of charities that accept Ethereum could be a whole site of its own. Each Charity Page could include an easy to use and embed donate button, links to the official websites, a short blog, a comment section, and so many other things.

##### 3) Searchable

Implementing a search feature should be of top priority.

### Current Status:

This version of the website is just a minimum viable product (MVP). It is currently a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) managed site hosted using Github Pages. The source code behind the website can be found [here](). It was built off of the [Smart Material Jekyll Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/smart-material-theme/).

### Nonprofit

Ideally **EtherForGood** will become a registered nonprofit. If it is deemed necessary to the success of the initiative, there is a chance that **EtherForGood** may start taking a minuscule percentage of the winnings. All funds donated or collected would go to covering operating costs, marketing, and paying developers.
